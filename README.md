## About Me

I’m a full-stack developer with experience designing and implementing **end-to-end web applications** — from database modeling and API security to frontend user experience.

I focus on writing **clean, maintainable code** and building systems that reflect real-world engineering practices, not just demos. I care about correctness, security, and clarity, and I approach personal projects the same way I would professional work.

I’m comfortable working across the stack and enjoy translating requirements into reliable, well-structured software.
